🌸 Data Augmentation for Flower Classification
📌 About This Project

This project shows how data augmentation helps improve deep learning models for image classification. Using TensorFlow/Keras, we apply techniques like flipping, rotating, zooming, and adjusting contrast to create more training images. This helps the model learn better and avoid overfitting on a small dataset.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
✨ Features

✅ Increases dataset size using data augmentation
✅ Uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify flowers
✅ Helps the model generalize better and avoid overfitting
✅ Uses TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
✅ Can be expanded with more datasets and techniques

📊 How It Works

Load the Flower Dataset – The dataset is downloaded using TensorFlow.
Apply Data Augmentation – Images are flipped, rotated, and zoomed to create new variations.
Build a CNN Model – A deep learning model is trained using the augmented images.
Train and Evaluate – The model is tested to see how well it classifies flowers.
Make Predictions – The trained model predicts the type of flower from new images.
🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Add more augmentation techniques like brightness and cropping
🔹 Try different flower datasets for better training
🔹 Improve the CNN model for higher accuracy
